Before doing anything, make sure you have installed Microsoft .NET Framework
4.0 AND Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0.  It has to be these versions or later. 
Earlier versions will not work.  Links to these are available at 
http://www.minecraftam.com/Downloads.aspx.

To install Minecraft AutoMap, you need to install Minecraft Forge first.

If you are updating AutoMap, you should run PatchMinecraft.bat which will enable AutoMap 
to extract any new textures.

WARNING: This version of Minecraft Automap is designed for a single specific version of Minecraft.
If you have a different version, your copy of Minecraft may stop working correctly.  
If this happens, try deleting the "version" file in %appdata%\.minecraft\bin
and then run Minecraft.exe again to redownload the game.
