# MinecraftAutoMap
An archive of the Minecraft AutoMap mod for Minecraft (Java Edition).  In 2016, I stopped developing Minecraft AutoMap (a.k.a. MinecraftAM or MCAM).  This repository is an archive of what was available before the website went offline.

## Version History
The latest Minecraft AutoMap release (0.7.9.2) was compatible with Minecraft 1.9.

See the [Release Archive](https://github.com/bp2008/MinecraftAutoMap/tree/main/Release%20Archive) folder for zipped binaries and source code for older AutoMap releases.

I've also saved some [PDF printouts of website pages here](https://github.com/bp2008/MinecraftAutoMap/tree/main/Website%20PDFs), which includes a [table indicating which Minecraft AutoMap versions](https://github.com/bp2008/MinecraftAutoMap/blob/main/Website%20PDFs/Release%20Archive.pdf) were compatible with which Minecraft versions.

## Website Archive

Archive.org has archived the Minecraft AutoMap website:
